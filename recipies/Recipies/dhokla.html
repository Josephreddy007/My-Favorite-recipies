    <p>Pav Bhaji is a popular Indian street food dish originating from Mumbai, India. It is a thick and spicy vegetable curry (bhaji) served with a soft buttered bread roll (pav). The dish has a rich history, dating back to the 1850s, when it was first served as a fast lunchtime dish for textile mill workers in Mumbai.

        Ingredients and Preparation
        
        The main ingredients of Pav Bhaji include a mixture of vegetables such as potatoes, peas, carrots, cauliflower, and onions, cooked in a spicy tomato-based sauce. The vegetables are mashed together and then fried in oil to give it a thick and creamy texture. The pav is usually buttered on all sides and served hot with the bhaji.
